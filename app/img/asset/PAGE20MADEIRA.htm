This year Irene and I wanted a sunny vacation and after some research on
 the internet we chose to go to the island of Madeira.
During my years in the Royal Netherlands Navy I have been there two or 
three times before and I knew that it is a beautiful island. During the 
last port visit I went on a sightseeing trip with other crew members. 
After the guide had told that there was a trout hatchery at Ribeiro 
Frio, I was very interested. The guide arranged a fishing permit for me,
 at a price of about two Dutch guilders. Next morning I grabbed my 
travel fly rod and took a cab to Ribeiro Frio and indeed did catch about
 ten little rainbow trout. They were small, but I had great pleasure in 
fishing for them. So when we decided to go to Madeira this year, it was 
clear that my old 7 feet travel fly rod would get a place in my 
suitcase.

In my opinion Madeira is a great destination for a nice family holiday. 
Nice people, a great climate and you can dine and wine deliciously. 
There is a lot to see and to do. Amongst other outings, Irene and I went
 two times on a whale and dolphin watching trip. The first time with a 
RHIB (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat) and the second time with the sailing 
vessel Ventura do Mar. On both occasions we indeed did see bottlenose 
dolphins, even on very close range. During the trips we also saw Cory's 
shearwaters and Manxx shearwaters. Species that we don't see every day. 
Further we scouted the island, had a look in a few of the beautiful 
gardens and of course did our share of lying in or at the swimming pool 
of the hotel
<br>
It is a very pleasant bonus that there is the possibility to do some fly
 fishing for trout. A permit can be obtained at the trout hatchery at 
Ribeiro Frio. It is not always that easy, because you have to find 
personnel present. Fortunately I was lucky and within a few minutes I 
had the desired paper in my pocket, it costed 1.5 Euro.

During my first morning fishing I encountered the local flyfishermen 
Herminio Rodriguez and his nephew Paul. They are busy setting up a guide
 service for flyfishermen on Madeira. They have a website, see the link 
below, this is still under construction. They told me that the stream at
 Ribeiro Frio dries up completely during summmer. The trout on Madeira 
was originally introduced during the fifties. The population of rainbow 
trout is self reproducing, they told me, and there are still some brown 
trout about, but they are few and far between. The browns seem to get 
replaced by rainbows. Because of the luggage restrictions of air travel,
 my thigh waders and wading suit were left at home. As a result of the 
very low water levels, I could get around with my regular walking shoes 
pretty well. But a pair of lightweight thigh waders still is very handy.
 The river at Ribeiro Frio is well fished with a 7 feet rod for a 2, 3 
or 4 line, but longer rods work fine too as there is enough room to 
cast. I got some little trout on both nimphs and dry flies. Because the 
water of the pools is nearly without any current, the fish can inspect 
your fly at ease and are not that easy to catch. The river cascades 
downhill very steeply from pool to pool and will be challenging for 
somebody that is not sure footed. Ribeiro Frio and its trout hatchery is
 a major tourist attraction and from 10 o'clock in the morning onward it
 will be very busy. Half a mile downhill you will find a nice restaurant
 at your right, there you can have a good cup of coffee and a lovely 
meal. The owner of the place kindly gave me permission to walk over his 
land to get to the river.
